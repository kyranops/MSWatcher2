  MSWATCHER2
</h1>

MSWatcher2 is a monitoring utility for MapleStory that helps to monitor your game for prespecified scenarios. It does so by matching target assets with the current game view and sending a Discord alert when the event is observed. MSWatcher2 also provides input assist to improve QOL of certain repetitive inputs.
MSWatcher2 **does not** perform any packet-sniffing or other actions that would constitute as hacking, and it **is not** a macro utility and will not help you farm.
MSWatcher2 simply watches for you, so you don't have to.

  Designed for Customizability
</h2>
All alerts can be toggle on/off, and alert messages can be fully customized without haveing to access the codebase
New alerts can also be added by the user without requiring coding knowledge, and can be added straight from the config.ini file
Alerts can be integrated with other native Discord functions, including @everyone pings or other discord bots to manage alert logs

  Lifetime Upgrades and Improvements
</h2>
MSWatcher2 started out as a passion project and I am constantly working on it to make it better and more efficient. 
New functions are always being added and existing functions are enhanced for reliability
Updating is also a simple process, as MSWatcher2 is fully backwards compatible. Simply drag-and-drop the new MSWatcher2.exe (and config.ini if specified)
